                The Ramayana, one of the greatest epics of ancient India, begins with the divine story of Lord Rama's incarnation. Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, decided to descend to Earth in human form to rid the world of the demon king Ravana, who had become invincible due to his boons from the gods. The gods approached Lord Brahma, who revealed that only a human could defeat Ravana, as he had received a boon that he would not be killed by gods, demons, or spirits.

                King Dasharatha of Ayodhya was a righteous ruler who had performed the Ashwamedha Yagna (horse sacrifice) to be blessed with children. Despite his noble deeds, he remained childless. Finally, the sage Rishyasringa conducted the Putrakameshti Yagna (ritual for progeny) at the king's request. From the sacrificial fire emerged a divine being who presented Dasharatha with a pot of divine nectar. The king divided the nectar among his three queens - Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. In due course, Kaushalya gave birth to Rama, Kaikeyi to Bharata, and Sumitra to twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.

                From his childhood, Rama displayed extraordinary qualities of righteousness, courage, and compassion. He was trained in the arts of warfare by the sage Vishwamitra and successfully protected the sage's sacrifices from demons. His divine nature was evident to all who encountered him, and he became beloved by the people of Ayodhya for his virtuous conduct.

                When Rama came of age, he was to be crowned as the crown prince of Ayodhya. However, due to a promise Dasharatha had made to Kaikeyi years earlier, Rama was exiled to the forest for fourteen years. Accompanied by his devoted wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshmana, Rama left Ayodhya without hesitation, honoring his father's word. This act of supreme sacrifice and filial devotion became a cornerstone of his divine character.

                During their forest exile, the demon king Ravana abducted Sita, taking her to his kingdom of Lanka. Rama and Lakshmana searched tirelessly for Sita, eventually forming an alliance with the monkey king Sugriva and his devoted general Hanuman. The epic tale of Hanuman's leap across the ocean to Lanka, his discovery of Sita, and the subsequent war between Rama's forces and Ravana's army forms the heart of the Ramayana.
